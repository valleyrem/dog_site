        <strong>Welcome!</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="form-decs">
        This website was created for fun and learning. It provides short, structured information about dog breeds,
        grouped according to the classification of the American Kennel Club (AKC) —
        one of the oldest and most respected dog breed organizations in the world, founded in 1884.
    </p>

    <p class="form-decs">
        AKC defines breed standards, organizes dog shows and sporting events, and serves as a reliable reference
        for breeders and dog owners. On this site, breeds are grouped following the same system for easier navigation
        and comparison.
    </p>

    <p class="form-decs">
        Currently, the AKC recognizes the following breed groups:
